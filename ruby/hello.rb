system "clear" // clears terminal everytime we execute the file.
#print doesn't change the line to execute another command.
print "hello people! -> "

#puts changes the line to execute another command 
puts "the next sentence starts from the below line"
puts "Hello, world!"

#so basically puts will keep everything together.
